# asp.netcorenorthwindapi GQL

A Web Api with graphql.net on a northwind test database.

This project was made with Graphql.Net for ASP.NET core. It follows almost all of the conventions including Repository Pattern, and Dependancy Injection such as dataloader for batching requests to the database.

Entity Framework core is also included and in the repositorys you can find and view how to work with EF Core.

If you want to clone the repository, and to see what is up in there, you must download the nortwind database short version, or non extended version to use the data that the web api is requiring.

This is still under construction and when near finishline I will try to upload it on Heroku for testing purposes.

#Info:

I have setup a dev branch in purposes to setup a schema that is provided through the EF core DB context, if you are interested to see, just switch to dev and clone the code.
